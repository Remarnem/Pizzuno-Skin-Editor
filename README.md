# Pizzuno-Skin-Editor
Unpackaged Chrome Extension to modify css values on https://pizz.uno/
## What is it?
I made this so that I could save the modifications I wanted to make to the pizz.uno website when I played it with my friends. I haven't really messed with css or js before so it may be complete jank. If you want to use this yourself, the variables at the top of changeTextures.js are commented with their default values as well as what each variable controls so it should be easy enough to modify.
